subtitle: Proving Motivation Though Finances

Finances are a powerful motivator for human behavior. This is especially true in criminal acts, where money motivates people to make mistakes. Graphically displaying finances can put jurors in the mind of desperate or greedy people.

From this simulated example drawn from a real-world case, you’ll see how someone’s balance dwindled to nothing during a few days in June. With no money left in his account and nowhere left to go, our defendant turned himself in on June 21st.

These exhibits require care to create because often the balance posted is not accurate because transactions have not completed.
