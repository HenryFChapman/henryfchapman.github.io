subtitle: Mapping Cities Using Building Heights

3D Renderings help juries see the context of where events took place. While regular maps certainly help, being able to see building heights in their own context puts jurors on the street. These exhibits are interactive, meaning jurors can play with them inside a jury room. They’re also mobile, meaning they don’t need an internet connection to view them.

The red building is a club, while the shooting happened at the intersection of Pine and Stanton Streets. You can move the vantage point, zoom in, and pan around the city.
