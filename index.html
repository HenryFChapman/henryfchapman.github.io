Currently, I'm a researcher at [Infegy](https://www.infegy.com), a data analytics company based in Kansas City.

In a past life, I was a data analyst that worked for prosecutors' offices around the country. I started a Crime Strategies Unit to track [gun violence](https://jacksoncomo.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/a3a7f7d4aa1c45a3b658dd2a4ecb582b) in Kansas City. I also wrote software to help attorneys investigate violent crimes. I led a project examining [racial disparities](https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article247534505.html) with drug cases that resulted in a 90% reduction in narcotics related felony prosecutions in Kansas City. I built [dashboards](https://jacksoncomo.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/b7db05881e914094aa4b872a0ed87455) that monitor how cases flow through the office and guide executive decision making.

Before moving to the Kansas City, I worked on criminal cases for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office in New York. Most of my work centered on homicides, but I assisted on  financial fraud, domestic violence and other violent felonies. While in New York, I led the technical side of New York State’s first homicide charged as [domestic terrorism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/local/race-war-murder-hate-crime/) and a year-long cyberstalking investigation.

I’m currently getting my masters at the University of Pennsylvania where I’m studying computer science. I earned my bachelors at Yale where I studied international relations with a concentration in terrorism and international crime. I did my capstone project on the mechanics of international arms trafficking across Latin American borders. While not studying, I worked in technology at Yale and in the US Intelligence Community.

I’m proficient in Python, scripting, and computer forensics tools like Magnet Axiom and Cellebrite. I have testified in multiple homicide trials, depositions, and government hearings.
