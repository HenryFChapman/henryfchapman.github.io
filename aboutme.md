subtitle: What I Do and What I Did
---

Currently, I'm a researcher at [Infegy] (https://www.infegy.com), a data analytics and visualization company based in Kansas City. 

In a past life, I was a data analyst that worked for prosecutors' offices around the country. I started a Crime Strategies Unit to track gun violence in Kansas City. I also wrote software to help attorneys investigate violent crimes. I led a project examining racial disparities with drug cases that resulted in a 90% reduction in narcotics related felony prosecutions in Kansas City. I built dashboards that monitor how cases flow through the office and guide executive decision making.

Before moving to the Kansas City, I worked on criminal cases for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office in New York. Most of my work centered on homicides, but I assisted on  financial fraud, domestic violence and other violent felonies. While in New York, I led the technical side of New York State’s first homicide charged as domestic terrorism and a year-long cyberstalking investigation.

I’m currently getting my masters at the University of Pennsylvania where I’m studying computer science. I earned my bachelors at Yale where I studied international relations with a concentration in terrorism and international crime. I did my capstone project on the mechanics of international arms trafficking across Latin American borders. While not studying, I worked in technology at Yale and in the US Intelligence Community.

I’m proficient in Python, scripting, and computer forensics tools like Magnet Axiom and Cellebrite. I have testified in numerous legal proceedings.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
